# Simplex

Simplex is a math problem which last in my mind over 20 years. 
I hope I can get rid of it after I'm writing down my solution.

The problem is as follows: Show that the volume of a simplex tend to 0 for higher dimensions. 
Maybe then formulation is a bit sloppy but I'm sure everyone will understand it.

In keeping with tradition I want to write the solution in Latex.
